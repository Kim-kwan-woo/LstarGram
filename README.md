# LstarGram

LstarGram is a Flutter application designed for users to browse and view 'stories' and 'posts'. It appears to fetch content, potentially product listings or similar items, from an external source and display them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- View stories in a horizontally scrollable rail and on a dedicated story page.
- Browse posts in a vertically scrollable rail.
- Access a history of viewed stories through a navigation drawer.
- Interact with content using 'Like' (Heart icon) and 'Share' (Send Diagonal icon) actions.

## Tech Stack

- `go_router` (for navigation)
- `http` (for making HTTP requests)
